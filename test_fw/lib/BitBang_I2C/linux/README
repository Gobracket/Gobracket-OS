BitBang_I2C Linux support
-------------------------
The Linux version will compile a C static library (unlike Arduino C++). If you
require a C++ interface, you can just change the makefile to compile it as such.

To build the library, just run make.
The I2C_Detector example is also included for Linux. To build it type:
> make -f make_sample
Since this uses the PIGPIO library to access the GPIO pins, it must be run as
sudo. The numbers used for the SCL and SDA pins are the header pin numbers, not
the BCM GPIO numbers. For example, to see if a RPI "HAT" EEPROM is present on
i2c-0, you would run it like this:
> sudo i2c_detect 27 28
This creates a software i2c bus on header pins 27/28 (BCM GPIO 0/1). If a HAT
is present, it will show a device detected at address 0x50.
